    "(1)Q. Who developed Python Programming Language?\n",
    "Ans: Python Programming Language  was developed by Guido van Rossum and first released in the year 1991.\n",
    "(2)Q. Which type of Programming Language does Python support?\n",
    "Ans: Python emphasizes support for common programming methodologies such as data structure design and object-oriented programming, and encourages programmers to write readable (and thus maintainable) code by providing an elegant but not overly cryptic notation.\n",
    "2. Python is an interpreted programming language, supporting object-oriented, structured, and functional programming.\n",
    "(3)Q. Is Python is case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "Ans: Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently. This applies to identifiers too.\n",
    "(4)Q. What is the correct extension of the Python life?\n",
    "Ans:  ‘Py’  is the correct extension of Python life.\n",
    "(5)Q.Is Python code complied or interpreted?\n",
    "Ans:  Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine.\n",
    "(6)Q. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python Language?\n",
    "Ans: A few blocks of code used in Python language such as a module, a function body, and a class definition. \n",
    "(7)Q. State a character used to give single-line comments in Python?\n",
    "Ans: We can write a single-line comment by adding a single ‘#’ character before any statement or line of code.\n",
    "(8)Q. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of Python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "Ans: The following function are are used to find the version of t Python that we are currently working on :\n",
    "1.Using sys. version method.\n",
    "2.Using Python_version () function.\n",
    "3.Using Python -V command.\n",
    "(9)Q. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called……………/?\n",
    "Ans: Lambda.\n",

    "(12)Q. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?\n",
    "Ans: A Python identifier can have a maximum length of 79 characters in Python.\n",
    "(13)Q. What are the benefits of using Python? \n",
    "Ans: Following are the some of the reasons why people use python-\n",
    "1. Python was meant for readability, reusable and maintainable as compared to other languages, easier to understand and it also supports all the modern features like OOPs and functional programming.\n",
    "2. The same program which is written in other high-level languages like c++ or java can be written in one-third or one-fifth line of codes. That means debugging can be easy and it will be less prone to error which in turn increases the productivity of the developers. \n",
    "3. Mostly it’s platform-independent, can run on any platform or OS with minor or no change at all which makes it a highly portable language. Now we can use MircoPython to interact with hardware as well. It can be used on most of the edge devices. \n",
    "4. Python already has a lot of inbuilt libraries that come with the standard python package which we download from its official site. With these libraries, we can build lots of basic applications or day to day automation tasks like copying data in bulk from one place to another. Apart from this, there’s a huge list of third-party libraries like Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, etc.\n",
    "4.  Its simplicity and availability of lots of supporting libraries plus huge open source community support make development in python a breeze. That’s why its widely preferred by hobbyists as well.\n",
    "(14)Q. How is memory managed in Python? \n",
    "Ans: Memory management is very important for software developers to work efficiently with any programming language. As we know, Python is a famous and widely used programming language. It is used almost in every technical domain. In contrast to a programming language, memory management is related to writing memory-efficient code. We cannot overlook the importance of memory management while implementing a large amount of data. \n",
    "In Python, memory is managed by the Python manager which determines where to put the application data in the memory. The procedure of providing memory to objects is called allocation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python Memory Allocation:-\n",
    "Memory allocation is an essential part of the memory management for a developer. This process basically allots free space in the computer's virtual memory, and there are two types of virtual memory works while executing programs.\n",
    "I.Static Memory Allocation\n",
    "II.Dynamic Memory Allocation\n",
    "Static Memory Allocation -\n",
    "Static memory allocation happens at the compile time. For example - In C/C++, we declare a static array with the fixed sizes. Memory is allocated at the time of compilation. However, we cannot use the memory again in the further program.\n",
    "Example:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack Allocation,\n",
    "The Stack data structure is used to store the static memory. It is only needed inside the particular function or method call. The function is added in program's call stack whenever we call it. Variable assignment inside the function is temporarily stored in the function call stack; the function returns the value, and the call stack moves to the text task and the compiler handles all these processes.Call stack (stack data structure) holds the program's operational data such as subroutines or function call in the order they are to be called. These functions are popped up from the stack when we called.\n",
    "Dynamic Memory Allocation:-\n",
    "Unlike static memory allocation, Dynamic memory allocates the memory at the runtime to the program. For example - In C/C++, there is a predefined size of the integer of float data type but there is no predefine size of the data types. Memory is allocated to the objects at the run time. We use the Heap for implement dynamic memory management. We can use the memory throughout the program.\n",
    " \n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Heap Memory Allocation:-\n",
    "Heap data structure is used for dynamic memory which is not related to naming counterparts. It is type of memory that uses outside the program at the global space. One of the best advantages of heap memory is to it freed up the memory space if the object is no longer in use or the node is deleted.\n",
    "(15)Q. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?\n",
    "Ans:  Following are the steps of installing Python on Windows :\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Install from the Google using Google chrome .\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: After this, install it on your PC. Look for the location where PYTHON has been installed on your PC using tge following command on your command prompt: cmd python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Then go to advanced system settings and add new variable and name it as PYTHON_NAME and paste the copied path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Then look for the path variable, select it's value and select edit\n",
    "Add a semicolon towards the end of the value if it's not present and then type %PYTHON_HOME%\n",
    "\n",
    "PATH variable:-\n",
    "The PATH variable is a list of directories where each directory contains the executable file for a command.\n",
    "When a command is entered into the Windows command prompt, the prompt searches in the PATH variable for an executable file with the same name as the command; i​n the case that the required file is not found, it responds with an error message that states that​ the specified command was not recognized.\n",
    "One way to overcome this error is to write the complete directory of the executable file instead of only entering the command name. However, this is not a very user-friendly approach.\n",
    "Another possible, and easier, way to avoid this error is to add the executable file’s directory to the PATH variable. Oftentimes, this needs to be done when installing Python.\n",
    "The complete path of python.exe can be added by:\n",
    "Right-clicking This PC and going to Properties.\n",
    "Clicking on the Advanced system settings in the menu on the left.\n",
    "Clicking on the Environment Variables button o​n the bottom right.\n",
    "In the System variables section, selecting the Path variable and clicking on Edit. The next screen will show all the directories that are currently a part of the PATH variable. Clicking on New and entering Python’s install directory.\n",
    "(16)Q.Is indentation is required in Python?\n",
    "Ans: Yes, Indentation is required in Python. Indentation is a very important concept of Python because without properly indenting the Python code, we will end up seeing Indentation Error and the code will not get compiled."
